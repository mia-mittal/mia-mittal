- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Netra Mittal! Iâ€™m currently navigating a masters degree in the Statistical Science program at Duke University. I'm an incoming Data Science intern at Meta (Summer 2024). Previously, I graduated summa cum laude with a degree in Economics and Mathematics from the University at Buffalo. My journey in between took a brief detour into the real world with a stint as an analyst in Ernst & Youngâ€™s Data and Analytics division.
